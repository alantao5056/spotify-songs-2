My name is Alan Tao, and this website is a project I made in [Kane's Free Data Science Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.davidkane.info/){target="blank"}. I'm really interested in music in general, so I decided to focus my project on this topic. Making this website took a lot of effort because bayseian regression models take a long time to run. Please support me by viewing my work and also my [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzdtyvYuUM6EGKhtsbF_jhQ){target="blank"}.

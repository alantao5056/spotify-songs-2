What makes music popular? Why do some songs get no attention, while some songs become mega-hits? Using data from Kaggle that uses spotifyr to collect 5000 songs from the 6 main genres of music (EDM, Latin, Pop, R&B, Rap, Rock), I seek to determine the important factors that make a song popular based on many variables about the song. I modeled popularity, a variable from 0 to 100 where 100 means most popular, as a logistic function of genre, danceabillity, speechiness, valence, tempo and duration. 25 points in danceability is associated with 3 ($\pm$ 0.25) points of popularity on a 100 point scale.
